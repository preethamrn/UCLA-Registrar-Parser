# UCLA-Registrar-Parser
Parses the UCLA registrar to check whether the classes that you're looking for have open spots

# Usage
Install Anaconda and any modules that the code asks for when you run it (but if you know what you're doing and already have python you can figure it out).

$ python Class_Parser.py
```
