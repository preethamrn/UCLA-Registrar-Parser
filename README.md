# UCLA-Registrar-Parser
Parses the UCLA registrar to check whether the classes that you're looking for have open spots

# Usage
Install Anaconda and any modules that the code asks for when you run it (but if you know what you're doing and already have python you can figure it out).
Modify the python script using the instructions in Class_Parser_new.py or Class_Parser_legacy.py (Class_Parser_legacy.py is simpler to use)
run on command line using:
```
$ python Class_Parser_new.py
```
OR
```
$ python Class_Parser_legacy.py
```
